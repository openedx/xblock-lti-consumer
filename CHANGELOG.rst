9.0.1 - 2023-04-11
------------------

9.0.0 - 2023-03-03
------------------
BREAKING CHANGE:

* Validates Tool provided ``redirect_uri`` against new ``lti_1p3_redirect_uris`` field per
  `LTI Specification <https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-3-authentication-response>`_.
* ``lti_1p3_redirect_uris`` defaults to ``{lti_1p3_launch_url, lti_1p3_redirect_uris}`` when empty to provide
  minimal distruption to existing integrations.
* **NOTE:** Since the redirect URI was never validated in the past, there is always a chance it is something
  other than the launch url/deep linking url, so you may have to explicitly set it as appropriate.

8.0.1 - 2023-02-03
------------------
* This releases fixes the PII sharing consent dialog for inline launches to no longer refer to a nonexistent
  "Cancel" button.

8.0.0 - 2023-01-31
------------------
* Update to work with bleachk>=6.0.0 and make that an explicit requirement in
  ``install_requires`` since the changes are incompatible with the older
  versions of bleach.

7.3.0 - 2023-01-30
------------------
* Rename edx-platform import of ``get_module_for_descriptor_internal``.

7.2.3 - 2023-01-24
------------------
* This release fixes a bug in the way that the PII sharing consent dialog renders. The bug resulted in the "OK" and
  "Cancel" buttons as well as the text of the PII sharing consent prompt appearing inside an inappropriate component
  when there was more than one LTI component in a unit.

7.2.2 - 2023-01-12
------------------
* Fixes LTI 1.3 grade injection vulnerability that allowed LTI integrations to modify scores for any block.

7.2.1 - 2023-01-10
------------------
* Adds support for LTI_BASE and LTI_API_BASE Django settings to allow URL configuration independent of LMS settings.

7.2.0 - 2022-12-15
------------------

This release addresses a number of issues with and bugs in sharing personally identifiable information (PII) in LTI
launches.

* Replaces the PII sharing consent modal with an inline PII sharing consent dialog to better suit the three different
  LTI launch types (i.e. ``inline``, ``modal``, and ``new_window``).
* Adds a PII consent dialog for ``inline`` LTI launches.
* Fixes a bug in the ``modal`` LTI launch in LTI 1.3 that was preventing the LTI launch.
* Fixes a bug in evaluating and caching whether PII sharing is enabled via the ``CourseAllowPIISharingInLTIFlag``.

  * This fixes a bug where the PII sharing fields in the LTI XBlock edit menu appeared regardless of the existence or
    value of this flag. The PII sharing fields will now always be hidden if either no ``CourseAllowPIISharingInLTIFlag``
    exists for a course or if a ``CourseAllowPIISharingInLTIFlag`` exists for the course but is not enabled.
  * This fixes a bug in the backwards compatibility code in ``lti_access_to_learners_editable``. Now,
    ``CourseAllowPIISharingInLTIFlag`` will always be created for courses that contain (an) LTI XBlock(s) that have (a)
    PII sharing field(s) set to True when a user opens the LTI XBlock edit menu. Before, this would occur inconsistently
    due to a bug in the caching code.

* Enables sharing username and email in LTI 1.3 launches.

  * Adds ``preferred_username`` and ``email`` attributes to the ``Lti1p3LaunchData`` class. The application or context
    that instantiates ``Lti1p3LaunchData`` is responsible for ensuring that username and email can be sent via an LTI
    1.3 launch and supplying these data, if appropriate.

* Adds code to eventually support the value of ``CourseAllowPIISharingInLTIFlag`` controlling PII sharing for a given
  course in LTI 1.1 and LTI 1.3 launches.

  * This code does not currently work, because the LTI configuration service is not available or defined in all runtime
    contexts. This code works in the LTI XBlock edit menu (i.e. the ``studio_view``), but it does not work in the Studio
    preview context (i.e. the ``author_view``) or the LMS (i.e. the ``student_view``). The effect is that
    the ``CourseAllowPIISharingInLTIFlag`` can only control the appearance of the username and email PII sharing fields
    in the XBlock edit menu; it does not control PII sharing. We plan to fix this bug in the future.

7.1.0 - 2022-12-09
------------------
* Add support for platform setting `LTI_NRPS_DISALLOW_PII` to prevent sharing of pii over the names and roles
  provisioning service.

7.0.3 - 2022-12-02
------------------
* Removed check against LMS specific `database_config_enabled` in LtiConfiguration model.

7.0.2 - 2022-11-29
------------------
* Fix the LTI 1.1 Outcome Results Service to be able to tie an outcome pass back to a user when the user ID is an
  `external_user_id`.
* Fix the LTI 2.0 Result Service to be able to tie a result pass back to a user when the user ID is an
  `external_user_id`.
* Update the `RESULT_SERVICE_SUFFIX_PARSER` regex string to be able to parse UUIDs to accommodate `external_user_ids`.
* Add a `get_lti_1p1_user_from_user_id` method to the `LtiConsumerXBlock` to get the user object associated with a user
  ID.

7.0.1 - 2022-11-29
------------------

Fix LtiConfiguration clean method to look only at location so that it can work in environments that cannot load the block.

7.0.0 - 2022-11-29
------------------
* Refactor anonymous user to real user rebinding function to use `rebind_user` service.
* Refactor accessing hostname from runtime attribute to using `settings.LMS_BASE`.
* Refactor usage of `get_real_user` with `UserService`.
* Refactor deprecated usage of `runtime.course_id` and replace with `runtime.scope_ids.usage_id.context_key`.
* Refactor deprecated usage of `block.location` with `block.scope_ids.usage_id`.

6.4.0 - 2022-11-18
------------------
Adds support for sending an external_user_id in LTI 1.1 XBlock launches. When the
lti_consumer.enable_external_user_id_1p1_launches CourseWaffleFlag is enabled, the LTI 1.1 launch will send an
external_user_id as the user_id attribute of the launch. When the lti_consumer.enable_external_user_id_1p1_launches
CourseWaffleFlag is disabled, the LTI 1.1 launch will continue to send the anonymous_user_id. The external_user_id is
defined, created, and stored by the external_user_ids Djangoapp in edx-platform.

6.3.0 - 2022-11-16
------------------
* Adds support for LTI 1.3 Proctoring Service specification in-browser proctoring launch.

  * Adds an Lti1p3ProctoringLaunchData data class. It should be included as an attribute of the Lti1p3LaunchData
    data class to provide necessary proctoring data for a proctoring launch.
  * Adds an LtiProctoringConsumer class. This class is used to generate LTI proctoring launch requests and to decode
    and validate the JWT send back by the Tool with the LtiStartAssessment message.
  * Adds an lti_1p3_proctoring_enabled BooleanField to the LtiConfiguration model. This field controls whether
    proctoring is enabled for a particular LTI integration.
  * Modifies the launch_gate_endpoint to support LtiStartProctoring and LtiEndAssessment LTI launch messages.
  * Adds an start_proctoring_assessment_endpoint to support LtiStartAssessment messages from the Tool.
  * Adds an LTI_1P3_PROCTORING_ASSESSMENT_STARTED signal. This signal is emitted when the LtiStartAssessment message is
    sent from the Tool to inform users of the library that the LtiStartAssessment message has been received.

6.1.0 - 2022-11-08
------------------
* 6.0.0 broke studio functionality because it leaned more heavily on the xblock load which only worked in the LMS.

  * Fix by greatly limiting when we attempt a full xblock load and bind

6.0.0 - 2022-10-24
------------------
BREAKING CHANGE:

Please note that additional breaking changes will be forthcoming in future versions of this library.

* Modified Python API methods to use config_id (the UUID field) exclusively rather than config.id or block.

  * For the functions changed in 5.0.0 the config_id is available in the launch_data.
  * Other functions had config.id changed to config_id and block removed as an argument.
  * The new function config_id_for_block gets that config ID if all you have is a block.

5.0.1 - 2022-10-17
------------------
* Fixed a bug that prevented LTI 1.3 launches from occurring in the browser due to Django's clickjacking protection.

  * Added the xframe_options_exempt view decorator to launch_gate_endpoint to allow loading response in an <iframe> tags
* Fixed a bug in the URL used for an LTI 1.3 launch; the library now sends LTI 1.3 launches to the redirect_uri provided
  by the Tool in the authentication request, instead of the preregistered target_link_uri.

5.0.0 - 2022-10-12
------------------

  the LtiConsumerXBlock instead
* Added a required launch_data_key request query parameter to the deep_linking_content_endpoint and refactored
  associated templates and template tags to pass this parameter in the request to the view

  LtiConfiguration.location
