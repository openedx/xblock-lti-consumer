# This file was generated by edx-lint: https://github.com/edx/edx-lint
#
# If you want to change this file, you have two choices, depending on whether
# you want to make a local change that applies only to this repo, or whether
# you want to make a central change that applies to all repos using edx-lint.
#
# Note: If your pylintrc file is simply out-of-date relative to the latest
# pylintrc rules in edx-lint, ensure you have the latest edx-lint installed
# and then follow the steps for a "LOCAL CHANGE".
#
# LOCAL CHANGE:
#
# 1. Edit the local .editorconfig_tweaks file to add changes just to this
#    repo's file.
#
# 2. Run:
#
#       $ edx_lint write .editorconfig
#
# 3. This will modify the local file.  Submit a pull request to get it
#    checked in so that others will benefit.
#
#
# CENTRAL CHANGE:
#
# 1. Edit the .editorconfig file in the edx-lint repo at
#    https://github.com/edx/edx-lint/blob/master/edx_lint/files/.editorconfig
#
# 2. install the updated version of edx-lint (in edx-lint):
#
#       $ pip install .
#
# 3. Run (in edx-lint):
#
#       # uses .editorconfig_tweaks from edx-lint for linting in edx-lint
#       # NOTE: Use Python 3.x, which no longer includes comments in the output file
#       $ edx_lint write .editorconfig
#
# 4. Make a new version of edx_lint, submit and review a pull request with the
#    .editorconfig update, and after merging, update the edx-lint version by
#    creating a new tag in the repo (uses pbr).
#
# 5. In your local repo, install the newer version of edx-lint.
#
# 6. Run:
#
#       # uses local .editorconfig_tweaks
#       $ edx_lint write .editorconfig
#
# 7. This will modify the local file.  Submit a pull request to get it
#    checked in so that others will benefit.
